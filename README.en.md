## Compatibility
Given the use of the `windows.h` library for console management, the releases only work on Windows systems (specifically Windows 10 and 11 where the application was developed and tested).
These console managements also, for the most part, only work with administrator privileges.
It's not necessary, it's just recommended for a better console.

## Development
The project was developed in Code::Blocks, so there is a project file for the game in the repository.
Releases are compiled in GNU GCC.
